    <h1>Apple Pie by Grandma Ople</h1>

    <p>An apple pie is a pie in which the principal filling ingredient is apple, originated in England. It is often served with whipped cream, ice cream ("apple pie Ã  la mode"), or cheddar cheese. 
        It is generally double-crusted, with pastry both above and below the filling; the upper crust may be solid or latticed (woven of crosswise strips). 
        The bottom crust may be baked separately ("blind") to prevent it from getting soggy.  
        Deep-dish apple pie often has a top crust only and tarte Tatin is baked with the crust on top, but served with it on the bottom.</p>
